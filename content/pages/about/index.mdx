The Pioneer Handbook is a collection of community resources and reference guides for Plutus Pioneers. The purpose of this Handbook is broader in scope than the Plutus documentation. It is a way to collect and organize resources for developing on the Cardano blockchain.

Developing on the Cardano blockchain is a much bigger task than learning Plutus. Among other things, it involves learning Haskell, understanding Linux, the EUTxO model, and also general web development. The Pioneer Handbook is a collection of community-created, curated resources made by other plutus pioneers to serve as reference.

[The Pioneer Handbook is open-source on Github](https://github.com/thakkery/pioneer-handbook) and other pioneers are encouraged to contribute posts written in Extended Markdown (MDX) through the GitHub.
