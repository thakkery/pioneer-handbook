This is a section of advanced recipes for working on the Cardano blockchain. It is for users who are comfortable with Linux and want to get a better idea of the tools involved in managing and deploying with the Cardano blockchain. This section is very much a work-in-progress, but will grow to cover tasks ranging from stake pool operations, smart contract deployment, and other kinds of advanced tooling.
