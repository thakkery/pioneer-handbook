There are a few important HTML tags to get started: `<p>` is the paragraph tag, `<a>` is the link (or Hyperlink) tag, and `<h1>` is a heading tag. The `1` represents its level or priority. 1 is the highest priority and 6 is the lowest priority, but they all generally hold a higher priority than a paragraph tag for organizing your content.
